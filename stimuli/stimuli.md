While sailing on the sea, a large storm came upon a captain and his ship. As the waves began to grow larger, the captain realized that his small vessel was too heavy and the ship would flood if he didn’t make it lighter.      

The only things on the captain's small boat were a single sailor, some small but expensive cargo that he was transporting, and a number of passengers.

While the cargo sank to the bottom of the sea, the captain and his ship survived the storm and returned home safely.
